To get this Djnago - UploadCare thing working you guys are going to need to follow these videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGw375nTqI

1. In Video 1
  1. Create an UploadCare account here: https://uploadcare.com/
  2. Make sure you have python installed in your terminal. You look see how to do this here: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
          * Notes we will be using pytho3 and above, in particular python 3.7
  3. Create a new directory where you want to store the project.
     You probably want to avoid calling this directory Python, or Django anything like that.
  4. In this directory you want to run: python3.7 -m venv env
     This is creating a directory where our virtual environment is placed. When you ls you should see a "env" directory
  5. To enter the virtual environment run: source env/bin/activate
     You know it worked if you see (env) USER$
  6. While in the virtual environment run: python
      And verify you are running python 3 or above
  7. To exit python run: exit()
  8. Now run: pip install django
     There may be problems with this step. You may need to run one of the following: pip3 install django
                                                                                     sudo pip install django
                                                                                     sudo pip3.7 install django
  9. To create the project run: django-admin startproject instapic
     This will create a instapic directory where there's a bunch of files n stuff in there
  10. To run the server: cd instapic
                         python manage.py runserver
      Go to your browser and type in: localhost:8080
      
2. In video 2
    * You can skip this one, but watch it for better knowledge if you want *
    
3. In video 3
   You're going to need to make sure you have mysql installed for this.
   Go to your terminal and run: mysql
            If nothing comes up then there may be one of two problems.
                1. You don't have mysql installed so go install it: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html
                2. Your pathing is bad
                      In this case run: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
                      And then run it again.
